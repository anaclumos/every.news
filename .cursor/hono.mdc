description: Hono.js best practices for building APIs and middleware.
globs: apps/engine/**/*.(ts|tsx)

- Use middleware for authentication and logging
- Implement route handlers using `app.get`, `app.post`, etc.
- Utilize 'c.env' for environment variables in Cloudflare Workers
- Structure routes modularly for maintainability
- Handle errors globally with 'app.onError'
- Use `c.text()`, `c.json()`, and `c.redirect()` for response handling
- Leverage caching with 'Cache-Control' or KV storage
- The LLMs.txt for examples and docs are located at ~/.llms.txt/hono.txt
